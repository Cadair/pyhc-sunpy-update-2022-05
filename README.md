# Org Mode Reveal Template

This is a template repo for making presentations in org mode with reveal.js.

This is mostly to help me quickstart a presentation, but hopefully it might be useful to others.

Combine `./export.sh` with [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr) to autorebuild the file on save and [live-reload](https://github.com/blaise-io/live-reload/) to refresh your browser when the index.html file changes and you have a live-preview.
