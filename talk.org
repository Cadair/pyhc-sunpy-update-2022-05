* SunPy Coordination Meeting 2022

SunPy is having its annual coordination meeting in hybrid format in August this year.

All are welcome to attend, more details are here:

https://sunpy.org/project/meetings


* New features in 4.0

The 4.0 release of sunpy (the 4th long term support release), was released at the start of May, its headline features are:

- Major improvements to affine transforms, which are used for rotating maps.
  - Now supports a much faster affine transform based on OpenCV, if opencv is installed.
  - Consistent behaviour between algorithms for NaNs in the images, NaNs as missing values and clipping.
  - A new decorator is also provided for registering your own affine transform functions (i.e. GPU or Dask based).
- Various other cleanups, see the [[https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/4.0.html][Release Notes]].


* ndcube 2.0

The 2.0 release of the ~ndcube~ package is a complete rewrite, and new API.

We learnt a lot of lessons in writing ndcube 1.x and decided that because of changes to WCS (functional coordinates) in Astropy it was a great time to rethink.

Changes include:

- All coordinate related information now stored in Astropy [[https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/wcsapi.html][WCS API]] compatible objects, with no bookkeeping in ndcube.
- ~.extra_coords~ is also now a WCS object.
- Vastly improved (and changed) ~.crop~ and ~.crop_by_values~ methods for slicing the cube based on world coordinates.
- Simplified quick-look plotting built in.

Read all about it [[https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/ndcube/en/stable/index.html][in the docs]], including [[https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/ndcube/en/stable/introduction.html#why-ndcube][why you might use ndcube]] (and not xarray).



* Work on ~TimeSeries~ has started under a HDEE Grant

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='left'>

A HDEE grant awarded to SunPy has hired a developer who is currently working on improving how our ~TimeSeries~ class renders in Jupyter notebooks (or just HTML in general).

* Other News from SunPy

We won a NASA grant under the "Open Source Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries" program for [[https://sunpy.org/posts/2021/2021-10-08_nasa_osftl_grant]["Strengthening the Foundations of the SunPy Ecosystem"]].
This includes money for technical infrastructure, coordinates, and documentation and teaching.

aiapy continues to develop with [[https://sunpy.org/posts/2022/2022-01-06-aiapy-demo][lots of instrument specific features]] for those working on AIA data.
